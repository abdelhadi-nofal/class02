# list :
1. Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is numbered.
<ol> The ordered list is created with the <ol> element.
2.  Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point
(rather than characters that indicate order).
<uI>The unordered list is created with the <ul> element.
3. definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the
definitions for each of those terms.
<dl> The definition list is created with the <dl> element and usually
consists of a series of terms and
their definitions.
# NESTED LIST
You can put a second list inside an <li> element to create a sublist
or nested list.

# boxes:
CSS treats each HTML element as if it lives in its own box.
# box dimension (width, height)
## min-width, max-width
Some page designs expand and shrink to fit the size of the user's
screen. In such designs, the min-width property specifies
the smallest size a box can be displayed at when the browser
window is narrow, and the max-width property indicates
the maximum width a box can stretch to when the browser window is wide.
### example :
<tr>
<td><img src="images/rhodes.jpg" width="200"
height="100" alt="Fender Rhodes" /></td>
<td class="description"> ...</td>
<td>$1400</td>
</tr>

# Overflowing Content overflow
** The overflow property tells the browser what to do if the content
contained within a box is larger than the box itself. It can have one of two values: 
1. hidden This property simply hides any extra content that does not fit in the box.
2. scroll
This property adds a scrollbar to the box so that users can scroll
to see the missing content.
# Border, Margin& Padding
Every box has three available properties that can be adjusted to control its appearance:
1. margin :to set the width of a margin to create agap between
 the borders of two adjacent boxes.
2. padding : is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it.
3. Border :separates the edge of one box from another.
# border-width 
The border-width property is used to control the width
of a border. The value of this property can either be given
in pixels or using one of the following values:
1.thin     2. medium      3.thick
# border-style :
You can control the style of a border using the border-style property. 
This property can take the following values:
1. solid a single solid line
2. dotted a series of square dots
3. dashed a series of short lines
4. double two solid lines : creates the sum of the two lines)
5. groove appears to be carved into the page
6. ridge appears to stick out from the page inset appears embedded into
# border-color
You can specify the color of aborder using either RGB values,
hex codes or CSS color names.
## It is possible to hide elements using the display and
visibility properties.
##  Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and inline boxes made into block-level boxes.
## Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of boxes containing text and the leading.
## CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image borders and rounded borders.
# Basic JavaScript Instructions
JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website.
with dynamic styling
### Variables in JavaScript
Variables are stand-in values that you can use to perform operations. You should be familiar with them from math class.
(var, const, let)
data type :
1. string
2. boolean
3. numbers
# decision making:
 to see whether a particular condition has occurred or not. and then to direct the computer to execute certain statement accordingly. ... The process of repeatedly executing a block of statements is known as looping.
 # Switch statements :
  are another way of handling decision making in your program. work just like if-else statements. The reason when they are used is when you have a bunch of if else if statements and it becomes difficult to read then you it change your code to use It executes once, unlike a loop which has the capability to execute multiple times. There is no loop control mechanisms, there is only conditional switching based on different cases.
  # A loop statement : 
  is a series of steps or sequence of statements executed repeatedly zero or more times satisfying the given condition is satisfied.
# comparison
1.  LOGICAL AND (give true just if all choises is true)
2.   logical or (give true just if all choises is true)
3.  logical not! (give the oppisite of var)
# if statement :
 checck the condition if the result true its execute the statement inside subsequince 

# TRUTHY & FALSY VALUES:
every value in JavaScript can be treated as if it were true or false
1. Falsy values are treated as if theyare false.
2. Truthy values are treated as if they are true.
# KEY LOOP CONCEPTS :
 programming structure that repeats a sequence of instructions until a specific condition is met. 
1. break : This keyword causes the termination of the loop and tells
the interpreter to go onto the next statement of code outside of the loop.
2. continue :This keyword te lls the interpreter to continue with the current
iteration
# LOOPS & ARRAYS
Loops are very helpful when dealing with arrays if you want torun the same code for each item in the array.
# USING WHILE LOOPS
This loop will continue to run for as long as the condition inthe 
parentheses is true.
## Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next.
## Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>)
are used to compare two operands.
## Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators.
## if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code
if a condition is true, and another if it is false.
## switch statements allow you to compare a value
against possible outcomes (and also provides a default
option if none match).
## Data types can be coerced from one type to another.
All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.There are three types of loop: for, while, and
## do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements
